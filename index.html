  <p>I&rsquo;m a <strong>full stack engineer</strong> with 8 years of experience and I just completed a one year travel break around the world. Highly passionated by software and computer in general, you will find me hacking around with a soldering iron and a Raspberry PI when I&rsquo;m not reading the latest items on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>.</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m back in Switzerland, I&rsquo;m looking at any opportunities with <strong>good software challenges</strong> and a <strong>solid team spirit</strong></p>

        <h2><i class="fa fa-code"></i>Programming</h2>
        <p>I started programming on a Comodore 64 at the age of 8. 18 years later, I received a Master degree of Computer Engineering from the <strong>Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne (EPFL)</strong> with a <strong>GPA of 5.5 on 6</strong>. Afterwards, I had professional experiences in <code>Java</code>, <code>C++</code>, <code>Python</code> and <code>Javascript</code>. But I don&rsquo;t want to limit myself to these since I strongly believe that every language has a purpose and may prove itself useful on some tasks (except Visual Basic).
      </div>
  
      <div class="wow fadeIn">
        <h2><i class="fa fa-coffee"></i>Methodology</h2>
        <p>Most of my professional experiences have been in an <strong>Agile</strong> environment. I have certifications from the Scrum Alliance for the roles of <strong>Product Owner</strong> and <strong>Scrum Master</strong>. I did assume both positions in my career. But more than Scrum, I do enjoy any methodology that encourages <strong>team collaboration</strong>, <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>continuous delivery</strong>.
      </div>
  
      <div class="wow fadeIn">
        <h2><i class="fa fa-cogs"></i>Software engineering</h2>
        <p>I did learn software engineering in environments where build systems, source control, code reviews, bug databases, test and test coverage enforcement are standard practices. I did enjoy it and for my next job, I hope to be part of a software team with a high mark on the famous <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/" target="_blank">Joel Test</a>. As for the tools, I did work with <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank"><strong>GIT</strong></a>, <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/" target="_blank"><strong>SVN</strong></a>, <a href="https://jenkins.io/" target="_blank"><strong>Jenkins</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.cruisecontrolnet.org/" target="_blank"><strong>CruiseControl.Net</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Gerrit</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible" target="_blank"><strong>Crucible</strong></a>,<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank"><strong>JIRA</strong></a> and  <a href="https://www.versionone.com/" target="_blank"><strong>VersionOne</strong></a> among others.

        <p>In my previous jobs, I became familiar with some well known (and some less well known) frameworks: <strong><a href="https://www.qt.io/" target="_blank">QT</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_blank">Python Flask</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Cocoon</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a> &amp; <a href="https://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cmake.org/" target="_blank">CMake</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://puppet.com/" target="_blank">Puppet</a></strong>  and <strong><a href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank">OpenStack</a></strong>. I&rsquo;m a quick learner and I always enjoy discovering new tools and frameworks (as for the CV done with <strong><a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a></strong>). As for the operating system, I know my way around *nix servers, embedded systems (QNX) and Windows.

    <p> The <strong>Neurorobotics Platform (NRP)</strong> developed in the Human Brain Project (HBP) is an Internet-accessible simulation system that allows the simulation of <strong>robots</strong> controlled by <strong>spiking neural networks</strong>. It targets researchers of multiple fields. Prospected users, include but are not limited to neuroscientists,  wanting to validate brain models in the context of closed action-perception loops as well as robotics researchers wanting to develop new neuro-inspired controllers. </p>

         <li><strong>Agile environment</strong> setup &amp; training for internal and external partners. After one year, two fully Agile and efficient teams were working on the platform. I took briefly the role of <strong>Scrummaster</strong> (for 6 months) and <strong>product owner</strong> (for 6 months) before other team members could assume the positions.</li>
      
         <li>Software development, especially around an <code>Angular</code> front-end and a set of <code>Python</code> REST services.</li>
      
         <li>Setup of a complete continuous delivery pipeline including the build system, the code coverage enforcement (along with metrics and KPIs), the package management (<code>RPMs</code>,<code>npm</code> &amp; <code>pypy</code>) and deployments (using <strong>puppet &amp; openstack</strong>)</li>

         <li>I did put a lot of efforts into getting knowledge and reusing software components made by other groups at the <em>Human Brain Project</em> (there are 12 subprojects). Our team ended up sharing tools for <code>Javascript</code>, <code>C++</code> (<code>CMake</code> template) &amp; <code>Python</code> with the other groups.</li>

    <p> <strong>Kollmorgen Automation Suite (KAS)</strong> is composed of a Windows programming environment (IDE) and of servo-drive embedded controllers. The target market is industrial assembly line automation. The IDE supports all <code>IEC 61131-3</code> (PLC) programming languages and is fully integrated with motion programming, hardware setup and configuration, testing and debugging, HMI development, network setup and other development tools. The embedded controllers run on <code>Windows XPe</code> and <code>QNX</code> (a real time POSIX operating system). They use <code>EtherCAT</code> and <code>modbus</code> field buses and they do ensure all the real time constraints for a multi-axis and multi sensors setup. </p>

         <li>Fieldbuses implementation (mainly EtherCAT).</li>

    <h2><i class="fa fa-trophy" aria-hidden="true"></i>Interesting challenges</h2>
    <ul>
      
         <li>I did rewrite the network driver of <code>QNX</code> specifically for <code>EtherCAT</code>. <code>EtherCAT</code> is an industrial bus based on Ethernet. It resulted in a <strong>60% average time gain</strong> in sending and receiving Ethernet frames. This allowed the whole system to run at a 4Khz frequency.</li>
      
         <li>The whole development team was looking for ways to increase our test code coverage. I introduced a <strong>Model View Controller</strong> way to code new <code>QT</code> based features for our programming environment. It became the standard.</li>
      
         <li>I did lead the search and the implementation of a highly efficient web server to run on our embedded system.</li>

         <li>The memory leaks in the code were quite important. Moreover, the code was intensively using shared pointers which didn&rsquo;t help fixing the leaks. In order to spot and fix them, I did use IBM Rational Purify to log the pointer address and the call stack at each increase or decrease of the pointer reference count. Then, with some <code>python</code> sorting, I was able to directly spot the place where the decrease reference calls were missing.</li>
